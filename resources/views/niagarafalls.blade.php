				<p class="text text-justify">Niagara Falls is named after the majestic waterfall that straddles the Canadian and US border, a popular tourist attraction for people from around the world to visit.<br><br>
				For the residents of Niagara Falls, Ontario, who call the area home, the tourism industry is a major driver of the local economy. This area is home to nearly 100,000 people, from diverse backgrounds.
				</p>
				<p class="text text-justify">It played an influential role as a stop on the Underground Railroad and became home to many former slaves fleeing slavery in the US during the 1800s. Due to the hydroelectric power which is plentiful and affordable, from power plants along the falls and river, the area served as home to a great deal of industry in the 20th century, though that activity has decreased in the past few decades, commensurate with most manufacturing and industrial job changes in North America.<br><br>

				Many traditional lenders impose credit score requirements on their loans, but we do not because we understand that life happens and that your past does not define your future.<br><br>

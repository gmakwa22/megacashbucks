				<p class="text text-justify">We look at more than your credit score, because we know that’s not a sure indication of who you are or what you’re capable of today. We also provide repayment options and loan amounts up to $1,500.</p>
				<p class="text text-justify">Our business is completely online and our application process can be completed in 5 to 10 minutes.</p>

				You could do it sitting over your coffee at Tim Hortons. It’s as painless and hassle-free as the state-of-the-art technology allows.</p>
				<p class="text text-justify">As independent as our application process allows you to be, though, don’t worry about what happens if any problems or questions arise for you. Our top-quality Customer Service Advisors will be on the spot, ready to help. </p>
				<p class="text text-justify">Our mission is providing you with the easiest, most ethical and transparent borrowing experience of your life. </p>

					<p class="text text-justify">Our commitment to residents of Hamilton, Ontario, is to make your financial life easier and less stressful.

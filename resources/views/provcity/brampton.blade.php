				<p class="text text-justify">Brampton, <a href="/payday-loans-ontario" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ontario</a> is the ninth-most populous city in Canada. Located in southern Ontario, it is home to nearly 600,000 people. It’s considered part of the greater Toronto area, effectively acting as a suburb of Toronto, at roughly the same distance from the city center as Mississauga. Being one of the southernmost cities in Canada, Brampton enjoys some of the most mild and temperate weather in the country. In days gone by, it was often considered the “Flower Town of Canada,” owing to the large growing industry and greenhouses that the mild climate afforded. While horticulture is less of a part of the economy today, Brampton is still a beautiful and blooming city, full of incredible diversity. It also serves as the Canadian headquarters location for many multi-national corporations. While corporations may not have trouble raising capital, individual citizens often can. When Brampton residents need a short-term loan, more and more of them are turning to {{$privname}}.</p>
				<p class="text text-justify">We are a leading Canadian online lender of guaranteed payday loans canada, providing convenient access to payday loans for residents of Brampton, the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, and several other provinces throughout Canada. Unlike traditional payday lenders, we are entirely online. There are no in-person office visits, no faxes, no notarized forms, no travelling, and no hassles.</p>
				<p class="text text-justify">We offer Brampton residents the ability to borrow up to $1,500 for a short period of time, and repay it either as one lump sum, or in 2 or 3 installments. Whether you call them payday loans, short term loans, or cash advance loans, these products provide consumers with quick and easy access to cash, to use as they see fit. Most people use a personal loan to cover bills and unexpected expenses, such as home or vehicle repairs, but it’s really entirely up to you.</p>
				<p class="text text-justify">Speed and convenience are both major benefits of the {{$privname}} lending process. The whole application can be completed online in 5 to 10 minutes, with approval coming shortly thereafter. Many people can be done with the entire process in 30 to 60 minutes. With the e-transfer funding option, funds are available within 5 minutes of completing the loan agreement. Direct deposit provides funds within around 1 business day in most cases. So, you can have your funds ASAP to get on with your life.</p>
				<p class="text text-justify">Just because we are an online lender doesn’t mean you have to do everything yourself. There’s a fully-staffed team of Customer Experience Advisors available by phone to answer your questions or deal with any troubles you may have completing the application process. They’re available 7 days a week during normal business hours in Brampton (9 am to 9 pm Monday to Friday, with shorter hours on Saturday and Sunday).</p>
				<p class="text text-justify">Some people worry about using an online lender, due to information security. This is completely understandable. So, when you take a personal loan from all of your personal and financial information is encrypted and protected. We take our customers’ privacy and security seriously, and never sell your information to third parties, either.</p>
				<p class="text text-justify">As a Canadian company, with Canadian values, we believe in ethical and responsible lending which means we don’t loan people more money than they can reasonably afford to repay. At the same time, we strive to provide options to all consumers in need of short-term loans. Unfortunately, many people with <a href="/bad-credit-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bad credit</a> have trouble getting access to loans and credit.</p>
				<p class="text text-justify">We believe bad credit should not be an impediment to a payday loan. A credit check is done as part of the loan application process, it’s not the only consideration, and we never reject applications solely based on credit scores.<br><br>
				We also believe in transparency, with no hidden fees or surprises. All our terms and rates are clearly spelled out, in plain English, as part of the loan application and agreement process.<br><br>
				Our goal is to provide Canadians, including the residents of Brampton, with the means to improve their financial situation, in an easy, fast, and secure way through our online lending process.</p>

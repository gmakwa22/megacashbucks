<h3>How can I get an express loan with bad credit?</h3>
<p class="newtext">There are no minimum credit score requirements to get an express loan. While a credit check is performed as part of the approval process, it’s just one of many things that we look at and having bad credit is not disqualifying.
Even if you have limited or bad credit, that does not stop you from getting a quick money loan.<br><br>
We believe that you’re more than just a number. Too often, credit scores are used as a substitute for thorough vetting and analysis of potential borrowers by online lenders.<br><br>
Our main consideration in the lending decision is whether or not you have the financial means to repay your express loans. We don’t believe you should be excluded from getting the urgent funds that’s needed because of your credit history.<br><br>
While no lender can offer guaranteed payday loan approval, we can promise you that we will never reject your application solely based on credit score.

<h3>Can I get an express loan the same day?</h3>
<p class="newtext">With an express loan in Canada, you can get the money you need that same day any time of day, any day of the week, any week of the year. Since everything is done online and is automated, round-the-clock service is possible.<br><br>
You can apply whenever you want, and your approval is handled by our software. The loan agreement is made available digitally and requires only a digital signature that takes just seconds to complete through our website.<br><br>
And then the funds are released so they’re available that same day, not just during traditional “bank hours.” If you choose the e-transfer option, funds from express loans are available in 5 minutes following receipt of your signed loan agreement. They’re not called “express” for nothing!

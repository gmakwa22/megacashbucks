              <h2 class="title">'5 Steps to Master Your Personal Finances'</h2>

      					<h3 class="small-title">How Do You Think About Cash? </h2>
      					<p class="text text-justify">Money is always on everyone’s mind: What you have, what you need and how you would spend more. In a recent survey from the Federal Government <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/programs/research/canadian-financial-capability-survey-2019.html" target="_blank">over 50% of Canadians</a> have some kind of concern about money at any given time. Of course, after the last couple of years, this concern is rooted in the unknown: What is happening in your World that you can’t control and what effect will this have on your day-to-day finances?</p>

                <h3 class="small-title"> How Do You Invest Your Time? </h2>
      					<p class="text text-justify">The average Canadian has 6 optional hours at their disposal, each day. This is the time they can do whatever they need: Do chores, exercise, plan for the future, learning a new skill, for instance. Many will simply watch T.V., go to pricey sports events, enjoy meals at restaurants and movies? The social pressures on everyone to spend their hard-earned cash on social events is huge but you must resist this, or at least dial it back and spend certain times of your week doing something that will benefit your future. You will soon get into the habit of using your time wisely. </p>

      					<h3 class="small-title"> How Do You Leverage the Life Experience You ALREADY POSSESS?</h2>
      					<p class="text text-justify">Most people see their past experiences as failures. They tried to complete some task or idea and it didn’t work out. However, look at most of the ‘successes’ that we see in our everyday lives: Edison is responsible for some of the greatest inventions and ideas that help run our modern world, but do we really think that these ideas just came to him, he executed them, and they were the massive successes we know today, immediately? Of course not! These successes were the result of continual experimentation, tinkering and flat-out failures. You must fail 100 times before you succeed. Look upon your past experiences as steps to a better future. Learn from them and apply these missteps to ensure a better outcome next time!</p>

                <h3 class="small-title"> What Would an Advisor Tell You to Do? </h2>
                <p class="text text-justify">You aren’t going to be a member of the 1% Global financial elite, you are going to enjoy the life you have, so it’s time to think about how to make your life as pleasant as possible. This means growing your income to a state that you can enjoy your everyday life, ensuring you secure your future with savings and get rid of your debt load. This is what financial freedom looks like.</p>

                <h3 class="small-title"> Financial risk taking.</h2>
                <p class="text text-justify">While you are re-organizing your life, you are going to be short of ready cash.

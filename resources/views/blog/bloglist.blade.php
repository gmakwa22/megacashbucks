             					<p class="text text-justify">Money is always on everyone’s mind: What you have, what you need and how you would spend more. In a recent survey from the Federal Government <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/programs/research/canadian-financial-capability-survey-2019.html" target="_blank">over 50% of Canadians</a> have some kind of concern about money at any given time. Of course, after the last couple of years, this concern is rooted in the unknown: What is happening in your World that you can’t control and what effect will this have on your day-to-day finances?</p>

                      <h2class="small-title"> How Do You Invest Your Time? </h2>
            					<p class="text text-justify">The average Canadian has 6 optional hours at their disposal, each day. This is the time they can do whatever they need: Do chores, exercise, plan for the future, learning a new skill, for instance. Many will simply watch T.V., go to pricey sports events, enjoy meals at restaurants and movies? The social pressures on everyone to spend their hard-earned cash on social events is huge but you must resist this, or at least dial it back and spend certain times of your week doing something that will benefit your future. You will soon get into the habit of using your time wisely. </p>

                       <p class="text text-justify">In times of intense financial instability, such as the current one provided by the COVID19 crisis, sometimes you just need to borrow from yourself to continue your standard of living. You can take from your savings and reallocate your budget as best you can, but when the chips are down and your bank account is about to hit empty, you may have to resort to something more alternative.</p>

                      <p class="text text-justify">It’s not necessarily the result of bad planning on your part: After all, we live in a world that is still adjusting to post-pandemic circumstances, and even the best planners can get hit out of the blue with a sudden expense that wipes out their savings – especially now that Canada appears to be going through a very bad weather phase and we are coming out of the traditional year-end spending season.</p>

Have you already made unreasonable resolutions to yourself to get things back under control next year? Do you have a plan? With COVID still with us in the form of the Omicron Variant, these last two years looks more and more like being ‘the norm’ for everyday life, but some of the restrictions we have become accustomed to could actually be your financial saviour and a great way to get your expenses more aligned with your expenses: </p>

                       <h2class="small-title">Rethinking Our Commute</h2>
             					<p class="text text-justify">How long has your car spent on the driveway this year? Have you gotten more used to commuting by Public Transit when you weren’t remote working? If there is one good thing about the Pandemic, it’s that more people are travelling by transit, when they realize they didn’t want to pay all of the Gas and Parking expenses required just to travel downtown for one or two days per week. This rise in ridership has led to a more fixed timetable and overall better service. All the buses and trains are now being disinfected often, everyone wears a mask and – as most of the ridership are parents – almost everyone can be counted on be vaccinated.</p>

In life, unexpected circumstances can easily become the norm when you are in need of funds and with no savings, you will be in a very challenging position. So, as a solution, look at taking loans for bad credit from reliable companies.</p>

                       <p class="text text-justify">While this is not a perfect situation for the borrower, it does fill the immediate need they have. Usually due to no fault of their own, they need money. Perhaps it is a medical emergency or sudden travel needs. Sometimes the requirements for ready cash are for the most basic needs of all. Whatever your reason, there are   out there to help you.</p>

Sometimes bills, expenses and unforeseen emergencies simply appear at the wrong times, forcing us to make choices between what we wish to spend (or need to!). So, what are you going to do? The Bank? More Credit Card debt (and how close are you getting to your limit?), sell something you don’t want to? Dip into your savings? You may want to look at loans near me, speedy cash near me, or cash advances.</p>

                       <p class="text text-justify">While you may nothing about Payday Loans, you may have an incorrect picture of what it entails: It’s no longer the predatory “back-street, leather-jacket-wearing hoodlum” working out of a trailer, in a sketchy part of town! The entire industry has grown up, has gotten less Predatory and moved online – just like your major Hight Street Bank has. Want some more assurances? Do some homework.</p>

                       <p class="text text-justify"> Everyone’s real cost of living changed in 2021. The ongoing Global pandemic had an unforeseen ‘fourth wave’ across North America, children under the age of 12 began their vaccinations, unseasonal weather affected most of the West and port closures, factory shutdowns, product halts and labour shortages are about to negatively affect the Winter Consumer buying season of November to April. How will this affect everyone’s buying power, this Winter?</p>

                       <p class="text text-justify">The Global Supply Chain has failed over the last few months, due to the reliance on the ‘just in time’ delivery method favoured by large companies over the last few years. It will take many months for things to ramp back up to the ‘situation normal’ we have all become used to. Look for less items on Canadian store shelves, not just over Christmas, but into Easter 2022. This will affect a lot of households and businesses.</p>

We all experience times when we are ‘cash-strapped’. For short term, ‘instant loans’, there are many choices open to you for Personal loans. It’s always best to educate yourself before borrowing money, and there is more to consider than simply how much you need to pay back. Think about how much you need, how long you need it for and how much it will cost you to borrow.
<br><br>
You are going to hear a lot about APR (aAnnual Percentage Rate), but if you aren’t borrowing funds for 365 days, or multiple years, then this isn’t too much of a concern for you. Just ensure you know how much your lender will charge for an ‘instant loan’.</p>

For many Canadians, the pandemic has proved that you can live and work in a different way, but now that we appear to have got this global health challenge behind us, is there a way that we can ‘build back better’ and make our lives better than before?
<br><br>
The answer is yes, and it’s easier than you think – simply look back at the habits you picked up while under ‘lockdown’ and continue on with them. Not only will it streamline your life, you will end up (- spending less and – hopefully – saving more, making your future better. You can even save some payday money!

                           As of July 20th, 2016, the Canada Child Tax Benefit (C.C.T.B.), was officially renamed the “Canada Child Benefit” (CCB). This change included some notable adjustments which leads to questions about a variety of different types of loans and the application processes that come with them.

                           One question that we frequently get is: “Will I qualify for a payday loan if I’m currently receiving the (Canada.ca Child Benefit ?” While the answer to this question varies from lender to lender, here’s how you can use your Canada Child Benefit income to qualify for a loan:

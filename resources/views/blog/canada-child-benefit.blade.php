              <h1 class="title">Getting a loan while receiving the Canada Child Benefit (CCB).</h1>
              <h2 class="small-title">All You Need To Know </h2>

              <p class="text text-justify">As of July 20th, 2016, the Canada Child Tax Benefit (C.C.T.B.), was officially renamed the “Canada Child Benefit” (CCB). This change included some notable adjustments which leads to questions about a variety of different types of loans and the application processes that come with them. </p>

                <p class="text text-justify">One question that we frequently get is: “Will I qualify for a payday loan if I’m currently receiving the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/canada-child-benefit-overview.html" target="_blank" >Canada.ca Child Benefit</a>?” While the answer to this question varies from lender to lender, here’s how you can use your Canada Child Benefit income to qualify for a loan: </p>

                <p class="text text-justify">The Canada Child Benefit is a government program that provides families and single parents with financial assistance. It is a tax-free payment that families or single parents can apply for when they have a child or children who are currently under the age of 18. </p>


                <h3 class="small-title">Can You Get a Loan with Your Canada Child Benefit? </h3>
                <p class="text text-justify">Though any loan you take out is typically dependent on your income, employment and credit history, you may be able to use your CCB as leverage to get a loan. Since your CCB is considered as part of your income, you can use it as a means to qualify for a loan. However, to get approved for a loan while on CCB, you’ll need to find a lender that accepts child tax credit as a form of income.</p>

                <p class="text text-justify">Personal loans (a.k.a. installment loans) have lower interest rates and longer repayment periods than a payday loan, so it tends to be cheaper and more manageable to pay off. When you get a personal loan, you’ll receive a lump sum of cash that you’ll have to repay with interest in equal installments over a period of time. :</p>

                <h4 class="small-title"> Personal Loan Amount </h4>
                <p class="text text-justify">When you apply for a personal loan that accepts child tax as a source of income, you’ll be able to qualify for a larger amount than with a payday lender. These amounts can easily range between $100 to $1,500.</p>

                <h4 class="small-title">	Interest Rates </h4>
                <p class="text text-justify">Interest rates on child tax loans are also lower than payday loans, making them a better option. The most a lender can legally charge you in Canada is 60% APR.</p>

                <h4 class="small-title"> Term Length </h4>
                <p class="text text-justify">One of the main reasons a personal loan is more affordable, is because it has loan terms than can extend to 5 years or more.</p>

                <h4 class="small-title">Loan Requirements for Personal Loans That Accept Child Tax</h4>
                <p class="text text-justify">Depending on the lender you apply with, requirements may vary. For example, while one lender may require a good credit score, another may not. Similarly, while one lender may require you to be employed, another may simply require a stable source of income. </p>


                <h3 class="small-title">Payday Loans That Accept Child Benefit</h3>
                <p class="text text-justify">Taking out a payday loan that accepts child tax a.k.a. “baby bonus <a href="https://www.megacashbucks.com/child-tax-loans" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">payday loan</a>” is becoming increasingly popular amongst cash-strapped parents. CCB payday loans are easy to get but should only be taken out in emergencies or in small amounts as interest is accrued immediately. </p>

                <h3 class="small-title">Main Features Of A Payday Loan That Accepts Child Tax </h3>
                <h4 class="small-title"> Payday Loan Amount </h4>
                <p class="text text-justify">You can only borrow up to $100 to $1,500 with payday lenders. However, that amount shrinks further as some provinces limit the amount you can borrow up to 50% of your net income.</p>

                <h4 class="small-title"> Term Length </h4>
                <p class="text text-justify">– Another aspect to consider when getting a payday loan is the loan term. Payday loans have extremely short terms, most varying between 15 and 30 days.</p>

                <h4 class="small-title"> •	Requirements For Payday Loans That Accept Child Tax </h4>
                <p class="text text-justify">– Most new payday lenders require proof of income, a valid bank account, and proof of identity to qualify. Most lenders also do not require a credit check, which makes it a good option for those with bad credit.</p>

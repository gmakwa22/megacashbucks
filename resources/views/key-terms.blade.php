			<p>An agreement is a formalized arrangement created between a minimum of two people or groups. When speaking about a private loan agreement, the agreement is a document that formalizes the terms of the loan between the borrower and the lender. By signing the loan agreement, the borrower is confirming that they promise to follow the terms of repayment. For this reason, it is important to carefully consider the cost and terms of a loan before signing a personal loan agreement. </p>

					<p>A credit bureau is able to provide a person's credit rating by collecting information on individual consumers from a range of sources. In Canada, the two most important credit bureaus are Equifax and TransUnion. Credit rating is used by lenders to assess someone's likelihood of repaying a loan, and is therefore a factor when deciding to accept or deny loan applications or determining interest rates. While some lenders use risk-based pricing to charge different rates based on credit rating, {{ $privname }} offers no credit check loans and a simple interest fee structure for all applicants.

					<h3>Credit rating</h3>
					<p>The credit worthiness of an individual, business, or even a country is described by their credit rating. Also referred to as a credit score, the credit rating is determined by calculating a range of factors such as current assets and liabilities and financial history. If you paid back your credit balances in the past, and continue to make your payments on time, then you will be given a good credit rating. You can maintain this rating by continuing to pay off your credit balance payments on time and in full.

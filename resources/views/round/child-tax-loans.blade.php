				<h2>Child Tax Credit Loans that Work</h2>
				<h2 class="small-title">Low Rates for Child Tax Credit Loans up to $1,500</h2>
        <p class="text text-justify">The Canada Child Benefit is a big help to lots of Canadian families in meeting the needs of the children. It helps with child-raising expenses right up until the child is 18 years old. It’s been colloquially over the years known as the “baby bonus.”</p>
        <p class="text text-justify">What you may not know is that you can get a baby bonus payday loan.<br>
        These benefits are guaranteed over the year, making them a qualified source of income when applying for a short-term loan with {{ $privname }}. Sometimes the costs of raising the children don’t come all in one even stream over the course of the year. When something urgent comes up, using your baby bonus to get a child tax credit loan can make all the difference in a tough situation.
        </p>
        <p class="text text-justify">Baby bonus benefits vary based upon a range of considerations. But in a family with multiple children the credit could be a $1000 or more each month. </p>
        <p class="text text-justify">Check out the Canadian government’s child tax credit calculator to get a better grasp on your own situation.
        </p>
        <p class="text text-justify">This money can be especially helpful when the parents are temporarily struggling to make ends meet. Such a situation could be a perfect one to leverage your baby bonus to get access to funds when you need them.
        </p>
        <p class="text text-justify">We allow you to use your baby bonus as part of your minimum required income to be eligible for a child tax credit loan that can be as much as $1,500.</p>

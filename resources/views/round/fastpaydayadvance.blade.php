                  <p class="text text-justify">What we’re interested in is your ability to repay. Just because things went badly for you in the past doesn’t mean you’re not able to repay today. We use our advanced algorithm to take in the whole financial picture of your situation. But of course, we don’t want to contribute to making your situation worse, so our Code of Conduct directs us to never loan you any money we don’t think you’ll be able to repay.</p>

                  <p class="text text-justify">Only dealing with a direct lender provides you the optimum level of consumer protection for your advance payday loan. Unfortunately, a lot of those offering you short-term loans online are not direct lenders, so you have to be careful. With PayDay you can rest assured, we are licensed to operate under both federal and provincial government regulations ensuring your financial safety.</p>

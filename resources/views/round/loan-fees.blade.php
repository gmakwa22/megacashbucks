													<p>As part of our commitment to responsible lending, we may at time make adjustments to ensure that each personal loan we give is in the best interest of our customer's financial health.

													<p>{{$privname}}'s lending process is fully transparent so you can clearly understand your repayment responsibilities. Depending on your pay period this daily fee may change. Your total amount to be repaid is the loan amount plus the interest fee, no additional fees will be charged to you.</p>
													<p>The only way that your repayment amount would increase is if you do not comply with your loan repayment agreement. You must make sure that your bank account has enough funds to cover the preauthorized debit on the date you agreed to make a loan payment. If your bank account has insufficient funds at the time of the preauthorized debit, you will be charged a missed payment fee, and your bank may also charge you a non-sufficient funds fee. From there on, collection interests will be applied to the remaining balance of your loan until it is fully repaid.</p>
													<p>From that point on, your file will be passed on to our professional collections team who will do their best to come to an agreement with you. Unfortunately, if you do not work with us to repay your loan in the agreed-upon time frame, {{$privname}} will have no other choice but to pass on your file to an external collection agency.</p>
													<p>The transfer of your file to an external collection agency may also generate additional fees for you, it can lead your credit file to a negative note and could damage your file for six years. Your credit file information can be passed on to other organizations by credit agencies and fraud protection agencies for verification purposes or to track your whereabouts in order to recover the sums owed.</p>
													<p>This is why we reiterate that it is extremely important to respect your commitments with us. {{$privname}} is a company with a human side and we understand that difficult situations may happen. If this is the case, please contact us as soon as you can so we can find an arrangement that can reduce costs for you and that will allow you to meet your commitments. However, {{$privname}} strongly recommends that you think seriously before applying for a loan. If you have any doubts about your capacity to reimburse this loan according to the established terms, we recommend you to find another source of financing.</p></div>

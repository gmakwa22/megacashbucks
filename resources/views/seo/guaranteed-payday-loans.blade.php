				                  <div class="acd-des" style="display: none;"><p class="newtext">There are no minimum credit score requirements to get an guaranteed payday loan. While a credit check is performed as part of the approval process, it’s just one of many things that we look at and having bad credit is not disqualifying.
Even if you have limited or bad credit, that does not stop you from getting a quick money loan.<br><br>
We believe that you’re more than just a number. Too often, credit scores are used as a substitute for thorough vetting and analysis of potential borrowers by online lenders.<br><br>
Our main consideration in the lending decision is whether or not you have the financial means to repay your guaranteed payday loans. We don’t believe you should be excluded from getting the urgent funds that’s needed because of your credit history.<br><br>
While no lender can offer guaranteed payday loan approval, we can promise you that we will never reject your application solely based on credit score.

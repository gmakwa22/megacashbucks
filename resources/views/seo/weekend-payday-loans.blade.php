				                  <div class="acd-des" style="display: none;"><p class="newtext">Anyone who meets the basic lending requirements and residents in one of the following provinces can apply for a cash advanced payday loan on the weekend:
<a href="/payday-loans-alberta" rel="noopener">Alberta</a>,
<a href="/payday-loans-british-columbia" rel="noopener">British Columbia</a>,
New Brunswick, and
<a href="/payday-loans-ontario" rel="noopener">Ontario</a>.<br><br>
Yes, you can. All that matters to us is whether you will be able to repay your loan. If you can do that, we don’t care about who you are, where in Canada you live, what kind of job you have, or much of anything else. As long as you meet our minimum requirements, you’re eligible for a loan – on the weekend or any time.

				                  <a href="#" class="acd-heading">Risks of a weekend payday loan?</a></a>
				                  <div class="acd-des" style="display: none;">The only real risk is the same one involved in taking out any loan. You should never borrow more than you cannot afford to repay. That of course will get you into trouble with collection agencies and a seriously damaged credit score. If you’re responsible in your borrowing, though, your weekend payday loan is risk free. Furthermore, our advanced algorithm also goes to work, assessing the big picture of your financial situation, to help insure we’re lending you a sum that will make your financial situation better, not worse.

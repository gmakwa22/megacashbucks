								  Meeting the monthly payments are a real challenge for a single parent. So much so that frankly the thought of Christmas isn’t always a welcome one. It’s hard to see that look of disappointment, when the children saw that we didn’t have much for Christmas. But I found out about a great option, that allowed me to have more control over my financial planning. I could get a short-term loan from {{$privname}}. They let me stretch my repayment over 3 installments. And they approved me in no time. It was just minutes. And the money was in my bank account 5 minutes later. I still have to be really careful in the months leading up to and following Christmas, but thanks to {{$privname}} and their great holiday loan opportunity, I can now provide my children the kind of Christmas they deserve. What a god-send. Thanks, {{$privname}}. </p>

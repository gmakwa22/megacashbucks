        <p class="text text-justify">You must have a bank account to secure a payday loan, but that doesn't mean you need great credit. In fact, the Canadian government reports that 88% of Canadians surveyed about their payday loans explained they have no line of credit.
<br><br>
Further, 45% of those surveyed stated their payday loan was used to cover necessary expenses. These expenses were mostly unexpected, such as car repair emergencies, while the rest were used for repeat expenses like utility bills.

<h3 class="small-title" style="color:#b2752d;">The Basics of Payday Loans</h3>
<p class="text text-justify">Payday loans are short-term loans that you can secure for a small amount of money. Usually, these loans are less than $500. Some provinces limit the amount of money you can lend through payday loans by law, sometimes up to $1,500.
<br><br>
They're called payday loans because typically borrowers are expected to pay back the loan with their next paycheque in about two weeks.
<br><br>
If other lending options are not available to you, such as because of poor or nonexistent credit, payday loans are your best option for getting money right away. </p>
<h4 class="small-title" style="color:#b2752d;">How to Get a Payday Loan</h4>
<p class="text text-justify">There are some general requirements that you must meet in order to secure a payday loan. Payday lenders want to assess the risk of lending you money, so they typically set standards you must meet. These standards mainly surround your:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Income Stability</li>
	<li>Permanent address</li>
	<li>Permanent bank account</li>
</ul>
<p class="text text-justify">For many lenders, you can receive a payday loan if you can show proof of a bank account that is at least 3 months old. You should also show proof of an income that you've been securing for at least 6 months.
<br><br>
In addition, you'll have to show ID and proof of an address that you've been living at for at least 6 months. This process ensures that the borrower has a way to pay back the loan once it's due and is less risky for the lender.
<br><br>
Before you can secure the loan, the lender will typically ask you to fill out a form that authorizes them to withdraw money from your account. This authorization form allows them to take out the loan amount in addition to the interest and any fees from your account once the loan is due.
<br><br>
An alternative to this form is to supply a post-dated cheque for the total loan amount and interest that the lender can cash on the due date.
<br><br>
In most cases, a payday lender will either give you cash or deposit the loan directly into your account. Some lenders, however, offer prepaid cards that you can use, but these often require an extra cost to activate.</p>
<h3 class="small-title" style="color:#b2752d;">Where to Get a Payday Loan</h3>
<p class="text text-justify">Payday loans are made available both in-person and online through payday loan apps. You can visit payday loan storefronts where you can apply and receive your loan physically. These stores will typically make an appointment for you to come back when your loan is due so that you can pay it back in person.
<br><br>
If you choose to secure a payday loan online, you will give your checking account information to the lender. They will deposit your loan into your checking account when you are approved. When your loan is due, they will withdraw the loan amount plus interest and fees.
<br><br>
There are both direct lenders and brokers that you can use to secure a payday loan. A direct lender approves and gives a loan directly to you, while a broker becomes a middle man that sells payday loans to the highest bidder. Using a broker can increase the costs of payday loans and might be less secure, as you're not in full control of who accesses your bank account information.</p>
<h4 class="small-title" style="color:#b2752d;">Do Payday Loans Have Interest and Fees?</h4>
<p class="text text-justify">Payday loans are more expensive than normal loans because payday lenders experience higher risks when lending. While traditional lenders can secure interest over a longer period of time on higher amounts of money, payday lenders are giving out short-term loans for smaller amounts. In order to stay in business, payday lenders have to charge higher interests and fees.
<br><br>
On average, payday lenders charge $15 for every $100 loan. When borrowers do not pay back the loan in full by the due date, payday lenders will add a late fee. Every new cycle that the borrower doesn't pay back the loan, the lender adds on another fee.
<br><br>
In some Canadian provinces, it is against the law for payday lenders to extend or rollover your loan. Make sure to check with your local ordinances to see what your options are.</p>
<h4 class="small-title" style="color:#b2752d;">How to Pay Back Your Payday Loan</h4>
<p class="text text-justify">Some Canadian provinces protect borrowers from extremely short lending periods by enforcing mandatory minimum loan terms. You have at least 62 days to pay back payday loans if you live in these provinces:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ontario</li>
	<li>New Brunswick</li>
	<li>Manitoba</li>
	<li>British Columbia</li>
	<li>Alberta</li>
</ul>
<p class="text text-justify">Depending on the payday loan organization, you can typically pay back your loan at the same location you received it. This might even be a requirement. If you've borrowed from an online lender, they will have access to your bank account electronically.
<br><br>
Payday loans are most often paid back by cheque or through electronic withdrawal.</p>

<h3 class="small-title" style="color:#b2752d;">Popular Work-From-Home Jobs</h3>

<ol>
  <li><b>Virtual Assistant</b> A virtual assistant (VA) supports entrepreneurs online in various ways, from uploading blog content to managing email accounts and scheduling appointments. Depending on what businesses require, a VA can focus on a specific task or do different ones in a day. For example, some VAs perform Shopify tasks exclusively, while others handle various marketing tasks. This job is ideal for individuals with excellent communications skills and those who enjoy assisting others.</li>
  <li><b>Online English Teacher</b> Teaching English online is one of the most convenient jobs for many Canadians because it involves using a familiar skill — speaking English. Many students from countries like Russia, South Korea, and Brazil often hire tutors to help them improve their English skills. If you have a university degree and work well with kids, this might be the ideal role for you.</li>
  <li><b>Freelance Writer</b> Working as a freelance writer from home doesn’t require any particular degree. Some companies prefer experienced writers, but language proficiency and skill are usually enough to land a job. It’s an ideal job to make quick cash, but you can also turn it into a full-time opportunity. There’s a variety of high-paying jobs across several industries for most writers.</li>
  <li><b>Proofreader</b> A proofreader is a person in charge of checking and correcting grammar and spelling errors. From publishers to video editors and public relations (PR) companies, many organizations need such services. In most cases, proofreaders work with freelance writers to develop content that attracts and engages audiences. If you’re a grammar whiz with keen attention to detail, this might be the dream job for you.</li>
	<li><b>Transcriber</b> Transcribers listen to live proceedings or recordings to develop written versions of the content clients provide. In most cases, organizations expect them to type at least 60 words per minute. Transcribers can work part-time and full-time and often get higher pay for industry knowledge, like medicine or law. If you excel in grammar and typing, you might make an outstanding transcriber.</li>
	<li><b>Customer Service Representative</b> Being a customer service representative is one of the most popular work-from-home jobs in Canada. To become one, you only need a fast internet connection, a landline phone, and a quiet spot in your home. As a customer service representative, your role is to help customers solve their problems. People who have a friendly disposition and can manage irate customers can excel at this job.</li>
	<li><b>Accountant</b> People often think of accountants during the tax season. However, they can perform various tasks, from documentation to data analysis. As most of these tasks are digitized, accountants can effectively work from home. In most cases, firms demand a degree and previous experience before accepting an application. As long as you qualify, you can earn substantial earnings from this job.</li>
	<li><b>Social Media Manager</b> Many companies outsource social media management tasks — which you can perform remotely. This role may seem like a walk in the park, but you need particular knowledge and skills to pull tasks off. A marketing or advertising degree can impress organizations, but you should also learn how to use the latest social media tools for posting content, boosting ads, and generating reports.</li>
	<li><b>Blogger</b> Becoming a blogger is more than writing catchy copy; it involves other skills like keyword research, photo editing, and search engine optimization (SEO). To make money as a blogger, you can practice affiliate marketing, place ads on your site, or write as a guest blogger for media outlets. Blogging is not your usual nine-to-five that pays by the hour, but it can be a rewarding endeavor if you learn its ins and outs.</li>
	<li><b>Online Seller</b> If you enjoy retail therapy more than most people, you already have an advantage as an online seller. With Amazon Canada’s FBA Program, the global fulfillment giant ships products and handles customer service for online sellers. The revenues and profits significantly vary depending on the sellers and products, but it’s an exciting way to make extra money.</li>
	<li><b>Online Survey Taker</b> Taking online surveys might be one of the easiest ways to make money online. If you have an internet connection and a phone — which most Canadians do — you can make money from anywhere in your home. While some surveys only pay a few cents for completion, keep in mind that they require no training or experience. You can perform such tasks during your free time.</li>
	<li><b>Website / App Tester</b> Some companies look for paid volunteers to perform tasks on websites and apps. As a tester, you should provide developers with feedback on your experience. Later on, they will collate comments and make improvements based on customer opinions. Performing the tasks of a tester shouldn’t be more challenging than using your phone to surf the internet or run apps.</li>
	<li><b>Translator</b> Luckily for Canadians, English and French-speaking translators are some of the most sought-after in the market. Additionally, you can perform these jobs from your home. As long as you have extensive knowledge of the preferred language, you can work as a translator. In most cases, companies look for translators for movies, games, and meetings.</li>
	<li><b>Voice Actor</b> The pandemic has boosted the demand for voice actors who can comply with their tasks remotely. If you have a studio set up at home and the talent, you can work as a voice actor. In most cases, companies look for professionals to grace movies, animations, company movies, and more.</li>
	<li><b>Web Developer</b> For many people, a remote web developer job is an ideal opportunity. As long as you have the skill, you can build websites and apps using only your computer and a reliable internet connection. It’s a high-paying job in an in-demand industry. However, keep in mind that some companies look for developers willing to work with teams.</li>

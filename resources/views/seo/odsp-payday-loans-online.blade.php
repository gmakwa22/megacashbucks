</h3>
<p class="text m-bottom">
We understand that many folks on ODSP or other social assistance programs often find it difficult and even painful to get around.

That’s an ordeal for anyone. That’s why we’ve made the process as easy and painless as possible. Using our website or app, you can apply from the comfort of your own couch, with no document hassle or standing in line.

We make the whole thing as flexible as possible. Your loan amount, your loan duration, and even your repayment plan, can be adjusted to your needs and circumstances.
	<br><br>
	You can borrow anywhere from $100 to $1,500. And your repayment can be done in 1, 2 or 3 installments – depending upon what suits your needs best.<br><br>
	And, even better still, if you choose to repay in 2 or 3 installments, we don’t charge you any more interest than if you paid in one sum.

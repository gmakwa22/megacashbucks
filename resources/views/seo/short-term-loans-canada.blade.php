				<h1>Short Term Loans</h1>
				<h2 class="small-title">In 5 minutes, get as much as $1500 straight into your bank account</h2>
				<p class="text text-justify">A short-term loan from Pay Day offers Canadians the kind of financial flexibility and security they need. Often called <a href="/payday-loan-canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">payday loans</a>, these kinds of lending products provide a lump sum cash payment, which is they repaid (with interest), typically after the borrower’s next pay period. Pay Day has taken this process several steps further and brought short term lending into the 21st century with a fully online, instant, no-hassle lending process.</p>
				<p class="text text-justify">At Pay Day, you can apply for a flexible <a href="/how-its-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cash advance loan</a> entirely online. There are no visits to offices, documents to sign and mail, faxes to send, or other wastes of your time. The application typically takes 5 to 10 minutes to complete online. Once submitted, it goes through an automated decision review, which includes a credit check. But don’t worry if you have bad credit – we don’t reject applications based on credit scores, and you’ll get a fair review like anyone else. After your loan application is approved, you can digitally sign your loan agreement, send it back online, and receive money in your bank account – as quickly as 5 minutes after we receive your signed agreement. And all of this without any physical paperwork or office visits. That’s lending for the way you live today!</p>
				<p class="text text-justify">Pay Day offers short term loans in Canada for bad credit and good credit customers. With flexible loan options, you can choose multiple repayment plan options, and take out a loan that’s sized to fit your individual needs. And since they are unsecured personal loans, Canadian citizens can use their new-found cash however they see fit. Our goal at Pay Day is to help our customers improve their financial situation and live better lives, by offering high-quality, affordable, and easy-to-obtain short term loans. <br><br>Online Payday Loans from Pay Day Offer Flexible Solutions for Quick Cash</p>

Competitive Rates
</h3>
<p class="text text-justify">
	<p class="text text-justify">
		Pay Day is a fully online lender. This means we can save significantly on overhead compared to traditional lenders. With no branch offices to pay rent and utilities on, and other savings that come from being an entirely digital operation, we can pass those savings on to our customers. This allows our lending rates to be competitive with most other major lenders, and often better than many other short-term lenders in Canada. A full and detailed listing of our latest rates, by province, is available on the <a href="{{$privurl}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">{{$privname}} website</a> at all times, and also fully disclosed as part of the application and loan agreement process.

	Short Term Emergency Loan Funding For Your Individual Needs
</h3>
<p class="text text-justify">
	There are no restrictions on how you use your short-term loan proceeds. The best manager of your financial situation is you, after all! Most people tend to use their short-term emergency loans to pay unexpected bills, like car repairs, home repairs, appliance repairs or replacements, and so forth. Still others use our loans as a cash flow management tool, to allow them to pay bills on time until their next pay check or government benefits check arrives. Still others like to use a personal loan from <a href="{{$privurl}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">{{$privname}}</a> to pay for a vacation, buying new home furnishings, or buying holiday presents for their children. Whatever your needs, a loan from Pay Day allows you to manage your finances as you see fit, on your own terms.<br>

	Bad Credit is OK at Pay Day
</h3>
<p class="text text-justify">
	One of the biggest reasons to choose Pay Day is that bad credit is OK – we don’t penalize you for having less-than-perfect credit. Our interest rates are fixed, based on the amount you borrow. We don’t charge more to customers with bad credit. Nor do we reject applications based solely on a bad credit score or credit report. All customers who apply for a <a href="/bad-credit-loans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bad credit loan</a> at Pay Day get a fair approval decision, regardless of credit score.

								<h4>Can I be approved quickly?</h4>
								Once you’ve filled out your application, our decisions system, with its advanced algorithm, gives you a decision almost instantly.
<br><br>
								Most of our customers have their money in the bank the same day. Once you’re approved and you sign your electronic agreement, our e-transfer system has the funds in your bank in 5 minutes.

								<h4>How Much Income do I Need?</h4>
Our minimum monthly requirement is an income of $800. Though a lot of sources, which you might not expect, can be counted toward this total. Include income sources in the Employment Details of your application and you're ready to go.

<h4>How about repayment?</h4>
We make repayment easy. Once repayment day arrives, we will simply debit the amount stipulated in your loan agreement out of the same bank account into which we made the original loan. All you have to do is be sure there are sufficient funds to cover the repayment. Other than that, there’s nothing for you to worry about.
